@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="For completeness, we mention that the coupling always connects vertices of different sublattices. For a connection as indicated in the Fig. \ref {fig:tworings}, the right triangle is identical to the one above. A closer inspection shows that the difference between the operator representing the left triangle differs from the one on the right by interchanging $a$ vs $b$ and $\alpha $ vs $\beta $ which yields a replacement $\protect \mathaccentV {hat}05EB_{00}\DOTSB \mapstochar \rightarrow \protect \mathaccentV {hat}05EB_{11}, \protect \mathaccentV {hat}05EB_{11}\DOTSB \mapstochar \rightarrow \protect \mathaccentV {hat}05EB_{00}, \protect \mathaccentV {hat}05EB_{01}\DOTSB \mapstochar \rightarrow -\protect \mathaccentV {hat}05EB_{10},\protect \mathaccentV {hat}05EB_{10}\DOTSB \mapstochar \rightarrow - \protect \mathaccentV {hat}05EB_{01}$ in Eq. (\ref {eq:B}). However, since the $B_{01}$, $B_{10}$ always appear in pairs, the MPO $O_6$ is the same."}
